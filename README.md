    - _The various types of tests and the frequency at which they should appear in the codebase’s test suite_
    - _Manual testing: takes more time, less accurate, error prone (repetitive => boring => negligence)_
    - Unit tests: isolated (mocking), largest layer => quickly
    - Integration tests: Less quick and often, interact with dependencies
    - End-to-end tests: User perspective, transversal so fragile and time consuming
